My project will try to predict the 2017 NBA Most Valuable Player Award by using data from NBA.com. The data used will be seasonal data from the past 15 years from the top vote getters to form a model that I will apply to the top players in the 2017 season. I will use data such as Points, Rebounds, and Assists, as well as advanced statistics such as PER and total Win Shares. By forming the model from previous seasons, I will be able to predict the Most Valuable Player Award winner in 2017.
